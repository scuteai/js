Authorization for your app's users.

- `scute.authz.can(action, resource?, context?)`, `canMany(checks)` and `permissions(resource?)`: the signed-in user asks about their own permissions (the app must allow client checks). A permission that needs a fresh verification answers `allow_with_step_up`.
- Server helpers on `ScuteAdminApi` (secret key): `authzCheck` (pass `challenge` to satisfy a step-up), `authzCheckBatch`, `authzUserPermissions`, `authzAuthorizedUsers`, `authzFilter` and `authzStartStepUp` (starts a verification bound to the permission).
- Data filters for lists: `toPrismaWhere(filter)` and `toSqlWhere(filter, { columns })` turn the API's filter into a query that selects exactly the rows the user may see; `matchesFilter` and `evaluateCondition` evaluate in memory. Missing values follow SQL's three-valued logic.
- React: `useCan(action, resource?)` (`allowed`, `needsStepUp`, `decision`) and `usePermissions()` (`has(permission)`).
