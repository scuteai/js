# @scute/auth-ui-react

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Add MFA enrollment suggestion flow and verifications API.

  - `@scute/js-core`: new `ScuteVerifyApi` exposed as `client.verifications`, with exported types `Verification`, `VerificationStatus`, `VerificationMethod`, `VerificationListParams`, `VerificationRisk`, `VerificationResult`. Adds sandbox detection and environment handling in `ScuteBaseHttp`. Emits `MFA_ENROLLMENT_SUGGESTED` when the server signals grace-period enrollment in a token payload.
  - `@scute/nextjs-handlers`: `createClientComponentClient` patches `signInWithTokenPayload` to surface `mfa_enrollment_suggested` from the server response so the suggestion event fires before `SIGNED_IN`.
  - `@scute/auth-ui-react`: `useScuteAuthFlow` routes users into `mfa_enroll_suggest` view after passkey registration when the client has a pending MFA enrollment suggestion, and fixes `skipPasskey` to not double-dispatch `authenticated`.
